Absolutely! Here is a **complete list of L2 (Layer 2) software architecture patterns**—the “service decomposition and basic orchestration” patterns—**with real-world use cases for each.**

## **Layer 2 Patterns & Use Cases**

| #  | **Pattern**                          | **Description**                                                 | **Real-World Use Case**                                                                 |
| -- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Decompose by Business Capability** | Split application into services by business domains             | E-commerce: Separate `Orders`, `Inventory`, `Payments`, `Shipping` microservices        |
| 2  | **Decompose by Subdomain**           | Use DDD “subdomains” to guide service boundaries                | Banking: `Customer Management`, `Accounts`, `Loans` as independent services             |
| 3  | **API Gateway**                      | Central entrypoint for all client traffic, proxying to services | Netflix: All mobile/web apps call a central gateway, which routes to backend services   |
| 4  | **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**       | Specialized APIs for each frontend (web/mobile/device)          | Spotify: Web, mobile, and desktop clients use separate BFFs optimized for their needs   |
| 5  | **Aggregator / Composite Service**   | Service aggregates data from multiple services into one result  | Travel booking: Aggregate hotel, flight, and car booking APIs into one unified response |
| 6  | **Proxy / Edge Service**             | Edge service handles auth, rate limiting, SSL, etc.             | Cloudflare: Acts as a global edge proxy for web applications                            |
| 7  | **Strangler Fig**                    | Gradually replace legacy monolith with new services             | Government IT: Slowly porting old mainframe modules to microservices                    |
| 8  | **Shared Library Service**           | Factor out shared logic/data into a reusable service            | Fintech: Central “exchange rate” or “user profile” service                              |
| 9  | **Service Registry & Discovery**     | Dynamic lookup of service endpoints                             | Kubernetes: Uses built-in DNS/service discovery for pods/services                       |
| 10 | **Gateway Offloading**               | Move auth, logging, validation to a gateway, not every service  | AWS API Gateway: Handles API keys, validation, rate limiting for all Lambda functions   |
| 11 | **Client-Side Load Balancing**       | Clients (not infra) choose which instance to call               | Netflix: Ribbon library in clients to pick healthy service nodes                        |
| 12 | **Sidecar Pattern**                  | Deploy helper process alongside main service (logging, proxy)   | Istio Envoy proxy as a sidecar for service mesh in Kubernetes                           |
| 13 | **API Adapter/Translator**           | Translate one API to another for backward compatibility         | Slack: Maintains “legacy” API adapters for older integrations                           |
| 14 | **Façade Service**                   | Present a simplified API, hiding internal complexity            | Banking: Public “account summary” API aggregates data from many internal services       |

## **How are L2 patterns used?**

L2 is all about **breaking up the monolith** and enabling basic modularity, routing, and integration.

* Modern microservices **always start with L2 patterns** before moving up to L3 (microservices), L4 (distributed), and L5+ (autonomous/cloud-native).
