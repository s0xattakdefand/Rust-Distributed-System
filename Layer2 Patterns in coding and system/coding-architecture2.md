Excellent question!
“**Code architecture OOP design**” is about structuring code, modules, and interactions at the **class/object level**—typically within a single application or service.

There are several **types/categories of OOP design patterns**, as well as broader code architecture approaches. Here’s a **summary** of the main ones:

---

## 1. **The Three Main Categories of OOP Design Patterns (GoF)**

The original **Gang of Four** book (“Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”) defined **23 classic OOP design patterns**, grouped into three categories:

### **A. Creational Patterns**

(How objects are created)

* **Singleton**
* **Factory Method**
* **Abstract Factory**
* **Builder**
* **Prototype**

### **B. Structural Patterns**

(How objects/classes are composed)

* **Adapter**
* **Bridge**
* **Composite**
* **Decorator**
* **Facade**
* **Flyweight**
* **Proxy**

### **C. Behavioral Patterns**

(How objects interact and responsibilities are distributed)

* **Chain of Responsibility**
* **Command**
* **Interpreter**
* **Iterator**
* **Mediator**
* **Memento**
* **Observer**
* **State**
* **Strategy**
* **Template Method**
* **Visitor**

## 2. **Broader OOP Code Architecture Types**

Beyond GoF patterns, here are **other types/approaches** to OOP code architecture:

| Type                              | Description                                                 | Example/Use Case                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Layered (n-Tier) Design**       | Split code into layers: UI, Service, Domain, Data, etc.     | MVC web apps, enterprise Java   |
| **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)**  | Core logic isolated from inputs/outputs via adapters        | Domain logic, testability       |
| **Onion Architecture**            | Domain core, with layers outward to infra/presentation      | Enterprise DDD                  |
| **Clean Architecture**            | Use cases/core entities in center, with “rings” outward     | Modern business apps, DDD       |
| **Entity-Control-Boundary (ECB)** | Define entities (data), controls (logic), boundaries (IO)   | Embedded systems, clear roles   |
| **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**   | Split presentation (View), logic (Controller), data (Model) | Web frameworks                  |
| **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**   | UI binds to “viewmodel” logic, decoupling UI/data           | Desktop/mobile UIs, .NET, Swift |

## 3. **Other OOP Patterns & Concepts**

* **Dependency Injection (DI)**
* **Service Locator**
* **Repository Pattern**
* **Unit of Work**
* **Active Record**
* **Specification Pattern**
* **Data Mapper**
* **Aggregate Root** (DDD)

### **Summary Table (Copy-Friendly)**

| Category     | Example Patterns                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Creational   | Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype                |
| Structural   | Adapter, Bridge, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Composite  |
| Behavioral   | Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Visitor, Mediator |
| Architecture | Layered, Hexagonal, Onion, Clean, MVC, MVVM, ECB      |

### **In Short:**

* **GoF Patterns** = 23 “classic” OOP design patterns (3 main categories)
* **Architectural Styles** = ways to structure your app/service code
* **Other Patterns** = DI, Repository, etc.
