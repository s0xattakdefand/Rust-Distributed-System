# ⚙️ Distributed Systems Patterns in Rust

Welcome to the **Rust Distributed System Patterns** repository — a curated and professionally implemented suite of **high-performance distributed system patterns** written in Rust 🦀.

> This repo serves as a hands-on lab and a tactical reference for engineers, architects, and educators building scalable, fault-tolerant, and production-grade distributed applications.

## 🧹 Included Patterns

| Pattern Name                  | Description                                                     | Language / Stack   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| ✅ **User-Based Sharding**     | Distribute data based on user ID hash for horizontal scaling    | `axum`, `tokio`    |
| ✅ **Consistent Hashing**      | Balance load dynamically across changing node sets              | `axum`, `seahash`  |
| ✅ **Gossip Protocol**         | Peer-to-peer information propagation with resilience to failure | `tokio`, `reqwest` |
| ✅ **Heartbeat Health Check**  | Liveness detection and auto-recovery heartbeat service          | `tokio`, `axum`    |
| 💜 **Leader Election (RAFT)** | Cluster coordination using leader consensus                     | \[In Progress]     |
| 💜 **Service Discovery**      | Runtime service registry pattern                                | \[In Progress]     |

## 🚀 Run Any Pattern

Each folder is a self-contained Rust binary crate. To run a pattern:

```bash
cd gossip-protocol
cargo run
```

Or for user-based sharding API:

```bash
cd sharding-pattern/sharding-pattern-types-user-base-sharding
cargo run
```

## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered

* 📦 **Sharding Strategies**: Load distribution, user-partitioning
* 🔄 **Consistent Hashing**: Dynamic node balancing with minimal remapping
* 🧠 **Gossip Algorithms**: Decentralized information spread
* ❤️ **Health Checking**: Fault detection and self-healing patterns
* ⚡ **Rust Concurrency**: `Arc`, `Mutex`, `tokio` async patterns
* 🔗 **Stateless APIs**: REST design with shard-bound logic

## 🧒 Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5)

> Imagine you have 100 toy boxes and 4 shelves. These Rust programs help:
>
> * 🧭 Know which shelf a toy goes to
> * 🪖 Help shelves talk to each other
> * ❤️ Make sure shelves are still alive
> * 🧠 Let shelves spread the news if one breaks
> * 💡 Automatically fix things if a shelf falls
