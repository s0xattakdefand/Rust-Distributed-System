### 🧩 Level 5 Pattern Categories & Their Proper Names

Each **pattern** at this level belongs to a **category type**. Here's a well-structured table for naming:

| #  | 📦 Pattern Name                    | 🧠 Category Type                | 🎯 Purpose                                                             |
| -- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Self-Healing Service**           | Resilience Pattern              | Automatically detects and fixes internal issues                        |
| 2  | **Service Discovery**              | Service Communication Pattern   | Enables dynamic location of services                                   |
| 3  | **Health Check & Liveness Probe**  | Observability Pattern           | Allows systems to monitor health in real time                          |
| 4  | **Retry with Exponential Backoff** | Resilience Pattern              | Retries requests safely with increasing wait time                      |
| 5  | **Secure Token Propagation**       | Security Pattern                | Passes identity/auth tokens securely across services                   |
| 6  | **Policy Gatekeeper (OPA)**        | Governance Pattern              | Centralized rule enforcement for access decisions                      |
| 7  | **Chained Circuit Breakers**       | Fault-Tolerance Pattern         | Prevents cascading failures across services                            |
| 8  | **Chaos Engineering Hooks**        | Fault-Injection Pattern         | Injects failures to test resilience (controlled disruption)            |
| 9  | **Event Replay / Event Sourcing**  | Data Consistency Pattern        | Maintains reliable state by storing and replaying events               |
| 10 | **Distributed Tracing**            | Observability Pattern           | Tracks requests across services for debugging and latency optimization |
| 11 | **Resource Budgeting (SLO/SLI)**   | Reliability Engineering Pattern | Limits failure budgets to maintain performance targets                 |
| 12 | **Intent-Driven Smart Routing**    | Adaptive Routing Pattern        | Routes traffic based on user or system intent                          |

### 🎯 Use Categories to Architect Cleanly

You can group these into **modules** in Rust:

| Rust Module Name     | Maps to These Patterns               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `resilience`         | Self-Healing, Retry, Circuit Breaker |
| `observability`      | Health Check, Tracing                |
| `security`           | Token Propagation                    |
| `governance`         | Policy Gatekeeper (OPA)              |
| `routing`            | Intent-Based Routing                 |
| `data_consistency`   | Event Replay, Event Sourcing         |
| `fault_injection`    | Chaos Hooks                          |
| `reliability_budget` | SLO Enforcement, Rate Budget         |

### 🧑‍🏫 Explain to a 12-Year-Old:

> Imagine your team of superheroes (services) working together in a giant HQ:

* Each hero **knows where others are** (Service Discovery).
* They all wear **badges with their powers** (Tokens).
* If one gets tired or hurt, they **rest and recover fast** (Self-Healing).
* They **don’t overwork each other** (Circuit Breakers).
* They **practice battle drills** by simulating monster attacks (Chaos Testing).
* And every move they make is **recorded on security cams** (Tracing Logs).

That’s Level 5 — your team doesn’t just fight, they **train, heal, communicate**, and **protect the mission.**
