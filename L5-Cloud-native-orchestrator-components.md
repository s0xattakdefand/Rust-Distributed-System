Here are the core types of patterns at L5, with simple explanations and real-world examples. We'll also note how you'd build each in Rust.

| Pattern Type                       | What It Does (12-Year-Old Style)                                                        | Real-World Use Case                                              | Rust Build Strategy                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🩹 **Self-Healing Service**        | Fixes itself when it breaks, like a superhero healing fast                              | Netflix microservices restarting when memory leaks               | Use `tokio`, restart tasks, watchdogs                   |
| 🧭 **Service Discovery**           | Like a superhero radar — helps services find each other                                 | Kubernetes internal DNS for services                             | Use `consul`, `etcd`, or build custom registry in Rust  |
| 📉 **Health Monitoring**           | Keeps checking its heartbeat to stay alive                                              | Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for alerts                         | Use `axum` or `actix-web` with `/healthz` endpoint      |
| 🔁 **Retry with Backoff**          | If it fails, tries again, waits longer each time like knocking politely                 | Payment microservices retrying Stripe calls                      | Rust `reqwest + tokio-retry` or custom backoff logic    |
| 🔒 **Secure Token Propagation**    | Carries security tokens across services, like ID cards                                  | Auth tokens across Google services                               | Use JWT with `jsonwebtoken` crate                       |
| 🛂 **Policy Gatekeeper (OPA)**     | Approves actions like a superhero council before taking action                          | GitHub's internal permission checks                              | Integrate Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Rust via REST    |
| 🔗 **Chained Circuit Breakers**    | Prevents system overload by cutting off broken services like turning off dangerous tech | Amazon turning off price service if recommendation service fails | Chain `tower::Service` with `tower::limit` and fallback |
| 🧪 **Chaos Engineering Hooks**     | Intentionally breaks stuff to see if it can survive like superhero training             | Netflix Chaos Monkey in production                               | Inject errors via feature flags or `cfg(test)`          |
| 📦 **Event Replay / Log Sourcing** | Rewinds the past like replaying battle footage                                          | Event sourcing in banking systems                                | Use `serde + Kafka` or `nats + JSON`                    |
| 🛰️ **Distributed Tracing**        | Follows a request across all services like a superhero GPS                              | Jaeger or OpenTelemetry tracing at Uber, Google                  | Use `tracing`, `opentelemetry`, `zipkin` crates         |
| 📊 **Resource Budgeting (SLO)**    | Tracks usage like giving each hero energy limits                                        | Google SRE error budgets                                         | Log metrics, define usage caps, expose `/metrics`       |
| 🎯 **Intent-Driven Routing**       | Picks the best service route based on your mission or purpose                           | Shopify using smart traffic shaping                              | Combine service mesh (e.g., Linkerd) with Rust logic    |
